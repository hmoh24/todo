# To-Do Project (Listify) 
Live link: https://hmoh24.github.io/todo/

This is the 7th javascript project from theodinproject curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list).

The aim of this project was to consolidate and put into practice the use of everything I have learnt so far. The project succeeded in increasing my confidence in general with web development due to my increased ability to solve the various problems that are associated with a new project. This is also the first project where I had to use many files/modules to construct the project piece by piece. At first it was difficult to think about how to structure the project, but having completed it I now have a better idea of planning out a project before I start it. I also have learnt how to download a node package and use it in my work (date-fns).

Unfortunately, I don't believe that I have used OOP extensively in this project, so I hope that in the coming projects I can practice the use of OOP, design patterns, and techniques that I have learnt but not implemented so far.
